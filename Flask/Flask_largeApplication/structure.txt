We are putting too much code in the app.py file, we've already seen how we put the forms in their own .py scripts file.
Let's explore how we could expand this organization further for larger flask applications.

|___app.py # main app.py file to be called to start server for web application.
|___requirements.txt # file of pip install statements for your app.py file.
|___migrations # folder created for migrations by calling.
|___myproject # main project folder, sub-component will be in separate folder
|      |      data.sqlite
|      |      models.py
|      |      __init__.py
|      |___owners
|      |      |      forms.py
|      |      |      views.py
|      |      |
|      |      |___templates
|      |      |      |___owners
|      |      |      |      |       add_owners.html
|      |      |
